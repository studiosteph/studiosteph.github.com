Some time ago I decided to revive my blog again. Not only because I think it's a waste of 'history' when throwing away all my written blogposts since 2006, but also because of the simple fact I wanted to fool around with [Jekyll](http://www.github.com/mojombo/jekyll). So I'm back in the blogosphere and planning on writing bits and pieces again whenever I feel like it. This month, I'm officially starting to work for my new employer. Let me tell you about it.
